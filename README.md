TOTALLY not copying https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5 😂

## Prerequisite
Turn on the auto jump from settings

## Steps
- Run ``collectdata.py`` to collect data, make sure your window size is ``800x630`` and is on top of the screen
- Train the data by running ``train.py`` (EPOCHS : 8 change it if you want to, higher number = more precise training)

🎉 Congrats

## Controls

- ``W`` to move forward not the arrow keys
- ``Mouse`` for left and right

## Run
Run ``index.py``

Tip : use ``t`` to pause stuff while collecting data
